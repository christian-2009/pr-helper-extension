    <h1>Privacy Policy for GitHub PR Comment Tracker</h1>

    <h2>Data Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
      This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. It
      operates entirely within the user's browser, analyzing and displaying
      information from GitHub pull requests in real-time. No data is sent to
      external servers or stored outside the user's device.
    </p>

    <h2>Use of Publicly Available Information</h2>
    <p>
      The extension may read publicly visible data on GitHub pull request pages
      — such as usernames and comment authors — solely for the purpose of
      identifying and displaying which comments may still require action. This
      data is used only during the active session and is not saved, transmitted,
      or shared.
    </p>

    <h2>How the Extension Works</h2>
    <p>
      The extension identifies comments on GitHub pull requests that likely
      require further action. It filters out resolved threads, comments with
      emoji reactions, and those where the last reply is from the PR author.
      These actionable comments are listed in a dropdown at the top of the page,
      allowing users to jump directly to them.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      All data processed by the extension is handled locally in the user's
      browser. The extension does not use any form of persistent storage, and no
      information is accessible to third parties.
    </p>
